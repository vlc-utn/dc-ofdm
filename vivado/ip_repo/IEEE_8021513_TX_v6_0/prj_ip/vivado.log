CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-3645] Please note that adding or importing multiple files, one at a time, can be performance intensive.  Both add_files and import_files commands accept multiple files as input, and passing a collection of multiple files to a single add_files or import_files commands can offer significant performance improvement.
