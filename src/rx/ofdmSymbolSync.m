function [ofdmSynched, delay, M, peaks, frequencyOffset] = ofdmSymbolSync(ofdmIn)
%OFDMSYMBOLSYNC Synchronize OFDM symbols using the Cox and Schmidl method.
% Both time synchronization and the CFO (carrier frequency offset) are
% calculated. Returns the ofdm signal with the delay and preamble removed.
%
% The CFO is based on the Cox paper, and assumes that the phase delay
% is less than pi (a phase delay less than "pi", is equal to a frequency
% delay less than "1/T", where "T" is the time duration of the message.
% For IEEE 802.15.13, "T is equal to the first 10 preamble symbols",
% therefore:
% Max delta frequency = 1/T = fsc / 10 = 50M/256 / 10 = 19.5 kHz.
% Considering that, by standard, the oscillators precision is:
% aPhyClockAccuracy = +- 50ppm, and the clock runs at 50MHz:
% Max frequency ofset = 2*100u*50MHz = 10kHz, which is lower than the
% maximum 19.5 kHz.
% 
% Note: "M" function from the Cox paper and "S" function from the peak
% detection function are almost the same. Therefore, simply "M" is used.
