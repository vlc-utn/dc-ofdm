# Simulink Examples for Vivado

This folder contains several examples to demonstrate the integration of Matlab and Vivado.

## Summary of examples

* **delayToRam**: How to map a large delay as a RAM. This is useful if the LUT usage is too big, and the RAM usage is low.

* **distributedPipelining**: Move delays to improve timing constraints.

* **exampleIpCore**: An example IP Core is generated, to test the workflow. No testbenches or further tests were made with this example.

* **logicOperators**: Combinational
